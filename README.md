# Lending Club Case Study 
#### Project is about to identify and analyse the 'risk' involved in approval of loan based on the profile of applicant.
#### The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking # actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

#### In this case study we perform some analysis based on the dataset avaialble and try to identify factors which help us to decide which applicants are more likely to default.
